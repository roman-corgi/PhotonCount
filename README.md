# Photon Count
Given an input stack of images, PhotonCount will return a photon-counted average image and can also output the counts corrected for threshold and coincidence loss.

## Getting Started

### Installing

This package requires Python 3.6 or higher. To install PhotonCount, navigate to the PhotonCount directory where setup.py is located and use

	pip install .

This will install photon_count and its dependencies, which are as follows:

* numpy
* mpmath


### Usage

For an example of how to use PhotonCount, see example_script_pc.py (which utilizes the emccd_detect package, https://github.com/roman-corgi/emccd_detect).

The example script of proc_cgi_frame (https://github.com/roman-corgi/cgi_iit_drp/tree/main/proc_cgi_frame_NTR) utilizes this package.
